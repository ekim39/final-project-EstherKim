# Final Project: Minesweeper (Esther Kim)

## Description
I recreated the game minesweeper using the game on google as reference (https://g.co/kgs/A6ZeS5o). The player can generate the board and then click any one of the tiles to start the game. If the player hits a mine, the game is over. If the player successfully uncovers all tiles except the ones with mines, then they win. The player can place down flags on the tiles with mines to mark them, which will prevent them from uncovering the tile with a flag on it.

The player will be able to create a username to log their scores and see them on a leaderboard.

### Technologies & Challenges
I used React and Express to create the frontend and backend of the web application. I used Express to set up server.js, creating routes for the frontend to call. 


### Turning in Your Project (Due Friday, June 27, 11:59 pm)

Submit a second PR on the final project repo to turn in your app and code. Again, only one pull request per team.

Deploy your app, in the form of a webpage, to Glitch/Heroku/Digital Ocean or some other service; it is critical that the application functions correctly wherever you post it.

The README for your second pull request doesn’t need to be a formal report, but it should contain the following:

1. A brief description of what you created, and a link to the project itself (two paragraphs of text)
2. Any additional instructions that might be needed to fully use your project (login information, etc.)
3. An outline of the technologies you used and how you used them.
4. What challenges you faced in completing the project.
5. What each group member was responsible for designing / developing.
6. What accessibility features you included in your project.

Think of 1, 3, and 4 in particular in a similar vein to the design / technical achievements for A1—A4. Make a case for why what you did was challenging and why your implementation deserves a grade of 100%.

The video described above is also due on Canvas at this time.
